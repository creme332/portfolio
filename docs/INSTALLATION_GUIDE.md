# Installation
This guide will walk you through how to install and run the project locally.
> ðŸ”´ **Prerequisites**: You need to have Node.js and Git installed on your machine to install and run the project. If you want to have a functioning contact form, you will also need a Gmail account with 2-FA enabled and a reCaptcha-v3 API key.

Clone repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:creme332/portfolio.git
```
Navigate to the project and install dependencies:
```bash
cd portfolio
npm install
```
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
```
EMAIL=
PASSWORD=
API_KEY=
```
Fill in the blanks where `EMAIL` is your Gmail address, `PASSWORD` is an app password (different from your gmail password) for your Gmail account, and `API_KEY` is your reCaptcha-v3 API key.
